## Why I Built This

This project was created for my portfolio to demonstrate:

- My understanding of **React app architecture** and component-based design
- Using **hooks like `useEffect` and `useState`** to manage data fetching and state
- Integrating with a **third-party API (TMDB)** for real-world data
- Experimenting with **Appwrite**, a new backend tool I wanted to try as a BaaS and CMS-like solution
- Applying responsive styling and accessibility practices with **TailwindCSS**
